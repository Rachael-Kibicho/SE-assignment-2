# SE-Assignment-2

Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Systematic approach to developing, operating and maintaining software.
It differs from traditional programming in that, unlike in traditional programming where the focus is primarily on coding, software engineering encompasses the whole software lifecycle, making it easier to create complex solutions, and to maintain the software.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase./n
Planning - Here we're defining the purpose and the scope of the project.
Analysis: Understanding the problem by collecting and breaking down information from stakeholders.
Design - Creation of a system architechure of the solution of the problem.
Implementation - Execution of the designed system architechture.
Testing - Verifying and validating that all the necessary functionalities are working well.
Deployment - The software tested is now made available.
Maintenance - Final and eternal phase where the system is supported by check ups, and adjustments if needed.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Both Agile and Waterfall models include a clearly defined series of steps toward software development, operation and maintenance.
Agile model is iterative and flexible, its iterations constitute the software development process. It is used in situations where it is not possible for all the requirements to be known at the start of software development and where user involvement is crucial at every step of the way.
Waterfall model is sequential and rigid in that every step is immutable and strictly follows another. It is used in projects where all the possible requirements are known and user involvement is not necessary up until the end of the software development process.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements Engineering is the technical approach to handling the needs and expectations given by stakeholders of the software system.
Requirements Elicitation - Gathering data from stakeholders about their expectations of the system
Requirements Analysis - Understanding the data gathered and how they come to solve the problem faced by the stakeholders
Requirements Design - Creation of documentation for instance System Requirements Specification, to formalize the understanding of the expectations of the system
Requirements Validation - Agreement or disagreement with the documented requirements to ensure correctness and completeness.
Requirements Maintenance - Checks and adjustments made to the requirements.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity - breaking down the whole software system into smaller components called modules to improve clarity, maintainability and scalability.
Maintainablity improved: Software systems that are modular are easy to maintain because testing of the units is done and whenever there is an issue, it is easy to see which module is causing the trouble. It is also easy for new developers who are handed the system to learn how to navigate through small well defined modules.
Scalability improved: Software systems that are modular are easy to scale because, whenever a functionality needs to be added, it's easy quick and smooth to delegate that task to a seperate team without interfering with other teams still working on the same project.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit Testing - Testing one part in a software to ensure each part works correctly.
Integration testing - Testing interaction of modules that are integrated to observe how they work together.
System testing - Testing the entire software, including all the modules, to ensure it meets all requirements
Acceptance testing - Testing the software as it is used by users to find out whether it is ready for deployment.
Testing is important to validate and verify user and system requirements of a Software and also to detect errors in the software.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version Control systems are systems that enable documentation to be collaborated upon and different versions stored for reference. An example is GitHub and it has features such as forking which is where you make a copy of another person's work and are able to work on it independently.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software project manager's role is to see a software through the whole cycle from concept to maintenance. Their responsibilities might include: communication of stakeholder expectations and delegation of responsibilities. Their challenges might include: resistance to change in developers when need arises, miscommunication between manager and developers.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Maintenance is where the software is monitored, its changes controlled and traced.
It is important to maintain software because, all software is flawed and require improvement, with changing user needs and just generally to ensure maximum efficiency and effectiveness of the software throughout its lifecycle.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Data privacy and protection - for example if the Kenyan government wants to track mpesa transactions of Kenyan users to determine whether enough tax is being paid by them, software engineers are faced with the dilemma of expsoing the data of mpesa users. Software engineers have to inform users about what exactly they are doing with the data that users give to them.
Inclusivity - for example if the font on a website is too small, software engineers are faced with the issue of inclusion of visually challenged users, because at the end of the day, inclusion is not only good policy but also good business.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
